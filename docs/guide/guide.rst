Introduction
------------

This introduction to programming series is targetted towards middle school
students and young mathematicians.

Basic Concepts

Why Programming?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all, what is programming? Programming, or rather computer programming,
is the process of creating a computer application to achieve some result: a
desktop app, a game, device drivers, etc., are all examples of computer
applications. Making nearly all of these requires computer programming.

So, back to the original question: why should you learn computer programming?
Frankly, its because computers are ubiquitous in modern society. Learning
computer programming will not only teach you the skills to creating computer
applications on your own, but the process of learning it will help you gain a
deeper understanding of how computers work.

Even if you are not planning on studying computer science or engineering in the
future, there are many fields that use computers or computer programming to
solve problems (protein folding, fluid dynamics, etc.).

What Are Algorithms?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To put simply, an algorithm is a process, usually consisting of multiple steps,
that leads to certain result. Examples of algorithms in daily life are cooking
recipes and building manuals.
